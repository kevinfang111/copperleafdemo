Pipeline:
- 

Improvements
- choose static webapp for simplification and cost savings
- As improvement, use kubernetes for better scaling

- Reliability
	- Create clusters using nodes with diff geographical regions
	- use traffic manager to direct web traffic

- add tags to add traceability and cost tracking
- add monitoring.  Application insights
- additional branching mapping to different environments (didnt want to do this as creating more environments potentially increases cost for the demo)
